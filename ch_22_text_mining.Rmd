Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
poem <- c("Roses are red,", "Violets are blue,", "Sugar is sweet,", "And so are you.")
example <- data_frame(line = c(1, 2, 3, 4), text = poem)
example
example %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)
```
